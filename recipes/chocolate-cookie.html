    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as 
        its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States around 
        1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the 
        chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe. </p>

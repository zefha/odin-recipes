    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and typically milk, then pan 
        fried. Alternative names and variants include "eggy bread", "Bombay toast", "gypsy toast",
        and "poor knights" (of Windsor).  </p>
    <p>The earliest known reference to French toast is in the Apicius, a collection of Latin recipes 
        dating to the 1st century CE, where it is described as simply aliter dulcia 'another sweet 
        dish'. The recipe says to "Break [slice] fine white bread, crust removed, into rather large 
        pieces which soak in milk [and beaten eggs] fry in oil, cover with honey and serve".</p>
